# Notes on ODG Fast Score

## First with docker compose on my mac.

You need docker and docker-compose.  type `docker-compose` and see if
you get help. They were for me so not going into that.

I am following [the fast score installation page](http://docs.opendatagroup.com/docs/getting-started-with-fastscore#installing-fastscore)

I put software systems that i am just playing with in  the `~/software`
directory.

    cd ~/software
    mkdir fastscore
    cd fastscore

Next create a database docker volume. As well as the `docker-compose.yml`

    docker volume create --name=db
    vi docker-compose.yml

and fill it with this from the instructions.


    version: '2'
    services:
      dashboard:
        image: fastscore/dashboard:1.3
        network_mode: "host"
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        environment:
          CONNECT_PREFIX: https://127.0.0.1:8001

      connect:
        image: fastscore/connect:1.3
        network_mode: "host"
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true

      engine-1:
        image: fastscore/engine-x:1.3
        network_mode: "host"
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        environment:
            CONNECT_PREFIX: https://127.0.0.1:8001

      database:
        image: fastscore/model-manage-mysql:1.3
        network_mode: "host"
        volumes:
          - db:/var/lib/mysql

      model-manage:
        image: fastscore/model-manage:1.3
        network_mode: "host"
        stdin_open: true
        tty: true
        depends_on:
          - connect
          - database
        environment:
          CONNECT_PREFIX: https://127.0.0.1:8001

    volumes:
      db:
        external: true


With that in place.

    docker-compose up -d

check that it is up

    docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

##### Set up CLI

You need python 2 to run this environment.  I have anaconda3 installed.. as
well as brew python2.  `/usr/local/bin/python` is brew's 2.7.13 so.

    virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python venv
    source venv/bin/activate

You will need to be in a python2 environment whenever you run the
cli commands.

    wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fastscore-cli/fastscore-cli-1.3.tar.gz
    tar xzf fastscore-cli-1.3.tar.gz
    cd fastscore-cli-1.3
    sudo python setup.py install

##### Configure the cluster

Next you want to create `config.yml` with the following content:

    fastscore:
      fleet:
        - api: model-manage
          host: localhost
          port: 8002
        - api: engine-x
          host: localhost
          port: 8003

      db:
        type: mysql
        host: localhost
        port: 3306
        username: root
        password: root

      pneumo:
        type: kafka
        bootstrap:
          - localhost:9092
        topic: notify

Then push that config to fastscore.

AND BOOM

Host networking doesn't work on `docker for mac`.

## ODG On Ubuntu 16.04

Team uses Ubuntu so use that.  A quick attempt with Centos 7 didn't work with host networking
so moving into the Ubuntu world of carefree living.

Downloaded ubuntu 16.04 from [osboxes.org ubuntu page](http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/)

Set up a virtual machine with 3 cpu and 8 gigs of ram.
To keep it super simple.. (since all I really need is the ports so I can
configure this for DC/OS)

    sudo apt-get update

Is always the thing you do in ubuntu.

Default python is python 2.7.11.. yay. Pip is not.
Note on the fail is to run. `sudo apt-get install python-pip`

Then do this page for [docker for ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)

You wont need to do the part they recommend for 14.04.

Next do docker compose with `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`

Oops if you do this when you run against their Compose script you will get a
cryptic error aobut `service 'version' doesnt have any configuration options.`
This just means that your version of docker-compose is not the right one.

[Here is the official page.](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

So:
    sudo apt-get remove docker-compose

You then create the db volume.

    sudo docker volume create --name=db

and then create the docker-compose.yml as in the mac section above,
followed by `sudo docker-compose up -d`.  Once it is running you should
see the following services listening.

    osboxes@osboxes:~/odg$ netstat -atp tcp
    (Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
     will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)

    tcp        0      0 *:8003                  *:*                     LISTEN      -
    tcp6       0      0 [::]:8000               [::]:*                  LISTEN      -
    tcp6       0      0 [::]:mysql              [::]:*                  LISTEN      -
    osboxes@osboxes:~/odg$ sudo lsof -i -P
    [sudo] password for osboxes:

    mysqld    11243 messagebus   30u  IPv6  52694      0t0  TCP *:3306 (LISTEN)


Next installed the CLI

    wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fastscore-cli/fastscore-cli-1.3.tar.gz
    tar xzf fastscore-cli-1.3.tar.gz
    cd fastscore-cli-1.3
    sudo python setup.py install

The first time I ran sudo python setup.py install I got the error.

    searching for websocket.client=0.37.0
    reading https://pypi.python.org/simple/websocket-client/
    error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

I ran setuo again and it succeeded.  I suspect just a transient error but
am noting it in case its is repeatable.   It would be easy to continue from here
and not have the thing fully installed.

Next I created the `config.yml` file with:

    fastscore:
      fleet:
        - api: model-manage
          host: localhost
          port: 8002
        - api: engine-x
          host: localhost
          port: 8003

      db:
        type: mysql
        host: localhost
        port: 3306
        username: root
        password: root

This leaves off the kafka section.

And then submited it to fastscore via the CLI.

    fastscore connect https://localhost:8000
    fastscore config set config.yml

Note that the documentation says config.yml whens howing the content of the
file but the documentation says `fastscore config set config.yaml`  the extra
a is not wrong..its just a file name, but it is a subtle typo.

At this point you can get to the dashboard.  Make sure to use https instead of http.
http will not work.
